Introduction
Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository. This repository showcases three key projects I've worked on during my internship with CodSoft, focusing on different aspects of data science and machine learning.

Projects Overview
Titanic Survival Prediction
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the survival chances of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models. This project leverages historical passenger data to train and test predictive models.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis

Model training and evaluation

Prediction of survival chances

Credit Card Fraud Detection
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes transaction data to train models that can detect anomalies and flag potential fraud.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis

Model training and evaluation

Fraud detection and alert system

Iris Flower Classification
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species using machine learning algorithms. This project uses the famous Iris dataset for training and testing the models.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis

Model training and evaluation

Flower species classification
